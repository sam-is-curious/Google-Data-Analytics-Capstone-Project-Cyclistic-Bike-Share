str(all_trips)  #See list of columns and data types (numeric, character, etc)
summary(all_trips) #Statistical summary of data. Mainly for numerics

#I cleaned and removed any NA's and duplicates in Excel before uploading to R

# There are a few problems I will need to fix:
# (1) In the "member_casual" column, there are two names for members ("member" and "Subscriber") and two names for casual riders ("Customer" and "casual"). I need to consolidate that from four to two labels.
# (2) The data can only be aggregated at the ride-level, which is too granular. I want to add some additional columns of data -- such as day, month, year -- that provide additional opportunities to aggregate the data.
# (3) I want to add a calculated field for length of ride since the 2020Q1 data did not have the "tripduration" column. We will add "ride_length" to the entire dataframe for consistency.
# (4) There are some rides where tripduration shows up as negative, including several hundred rides where Divvy took bikes out of circulation for Quality Control reasons. I want to delete these rides.

# In the "member_casual" column, I replaced "Subscriber" with "member" and "Customer" with "casual"
# Divvy used different labels for these two types of riders ... I want to make our dataframe consistent with their current nomenclature
# N.B.: "Level" is a special property of a column that is retained even if a subset does not contain any values from a specific level

```
According to this graph, Monday - Friday, customers are less likely to ride bikes in comparison to subscribers. However, on Saturday and Sunday, customers are more privy to ride bikes.

 For the type of bikes used during the weekday, it seems that customers and subscribers enjoy the classic bike with the electric bike coming in second

For ride duration for a full year, the peak for customers is in the months of Dec and May. The lowest month for customers is in Feb. In comparison, the peak for subscribers is also in Dec followed by April, May, and June. The lowest months for subscribers are Aug, Nov, Jan, and Mar.
